## Setting Up

### Create Docker Container 
First, generate Docker container by running the following command `python3 main.py` from the repository's main directory. 

### Python Environment

***To install the current Python dependencies***

Run the following command `pip install -r requirement.txt`.

***To install new python packages and dependencies***

Please enter the environment first, by running the following command `source env/bin/activate`. Now, you can install any necessary python packages. 

Once finished, run `deactivate` to exit the python environment. However, make sure to export the installed packages to requirements.txt by running the command `pip freeze > requirement.txt`. Also remember to add requirements.txt to your commit!
